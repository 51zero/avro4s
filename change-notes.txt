Encoder, Decoder, Codecs:
- Introducing Codecs as combination of Encoder / Decoder.
- EncoderV2 and DecoderV2 for now
- in the following, codec means EncoderV2, DecoderV2 and Codec.

Schemas and Codecs:
- SchemaForV2 for now.
- Codecs have pre-packaged schemas that can be specialized via withSchema.
- This pre-packaging allows to pre-compute name mappings that involve reflection.
- withSchema produces a modified codec that re-computes name mappings.
- records propagate schemas down to fields, union types propagate schemas to their elements
- namespace overrides from fields and sealed traits are handled with custom logic using "ModifiableNamespaceCodec".

Other:
- Shapeless coproduct decoding is based on partial functions instead of SafeFrom
